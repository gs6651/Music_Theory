## Note
## Chord
## Interval

The distance between the pitch of two notes, or simply gaps (or distance or space or steps) between two notes:
-   Pitch is basically a frequency of note. Higher the frequency, higher the note will be. Lower the frequency, lower the note will be.
-   Two types of Intervals:
    -   Half-Step = One Fret = Half-tone or Semitone
    -   Whole-Step = Two Fret = Whole-Tone
-   Intervals are the building blocks of Music.
-   Harmonic intervals are the building blocks of Chords.
Any two notes played together are called harmonic intervals.
Melodic intervals are the building blocks of Scales.
In melody one note is played at a time.
Melodies are usually played on higher strings.
Starting note of an interval is called root-note. And then:
Unison
minor 2nd
Major 2nd
minor 3rd
Major 3rd
Augmented 4th / Diminished 5th / Tritone
Perfect 5th
minor 6th
Major 6th
minor 7th
Major 7th
Octave
Intervals are named with a number and quality such as:
Number: How many note letters the interval covers
Quality: Describes the sound of interval
minor
Major
Perfect
Augmented
Diminished

Octave: An interval of 8 notes of a musical scale that shares notes of the same name – e.g. from a low C to a high C.



Major Scale Chord Progression
	1. Make a Major Scale
	2. Convert Note names to Chord names
		a. M m m M M m D
	3. Arrange a few chords from a key
	4. Pick a strumming pattern
	5. Experiment, Play Around



## Keys

The group of pitches (the scale) that is used in a song.
There are only two Keys:
-   Major Key: There are only 7 notes (Out of 12 notes) in a Major Key.
    -   Formula for Major Scale is: W-W-H-W-W-W-H (That's a spacing between the notes)
    -   Cmaj Scale would be: C D E F G A B C
    -   Amaj Scale would be: A B C# D E F# G# A
    -   In Major Scales, letter names appear only once, no matter how many accidentals there are
    -   A# Maj Scale would be: B♭ C D E♭ F G A B♭
-   Minor Key: Same goes for Minor Key as well. Only 7 Notes
-   Relative keys: Keys that share the same notes but start on different notes – e.g., C major and A minor contain the same notes, but C major starts on C while A minor starts on A


## Scales

Organized sequences of notes played in an ascending or descending order. The distance, or interval, between notes in a scale determines its sound and character.
-   Chromatic scale: A scale including all 12 notes
-   Pentatonic scale: A scale containing only 5 unique notes
-   Major scale: 
-   Minor scale: 

## Triads

### Major Triads

| Chord | Root | Major 3rd | Perfect 5th |
| - | - | - | - |
| C Major | C | E | G |
| C# / Db | C# / Db | E# / F | G# / Ab |
| D | D | F# | A |
| Eb | Eb | G | Bb |
| E | E | G# | B |
| F | F | A | C |
| F# / Gb | F# / Gb | A# / Bb | C# / Db |
| G | G | B | D |
| Ab | Ab | C | Eb |
| A | A | C# | E |
| Bb | Bb | D | F |
| B | B | D# | F# |
